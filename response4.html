		<h2>research & destroy <br> a plea for design as research</h2>  
		<h3>daniel van der velden</h3>
</div>
		 <p> "We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need." <br> 
		 	1. it seems consumerism has found a way to psycholgically manipulate the consumer to believe the notion that materialism correlates to our spirituality, so how do we make design less hedonistic and more sustainable? 
		 	<br>
		 	2. do we need to redefine what a designer is today? especially in this state of climate change and sustainabilty..?
