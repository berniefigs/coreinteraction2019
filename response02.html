		 <p> What Happens When You Create A Flexbox Flex Container? <br> 
		 	A flexbox is a design element a combination of an inner and outer display model. The outer display type is the "block" and the inner display is the "flex", so the items inside the container will be affected. The value "inline-flex" is a flex container that acts like an inline level element. Then when using flexbox, will you be using it for rows or columns? Flex-directions include column, row-reverse, and column-reverse. So basically one is just controlling the contents of the container when using flexboxes.

		 	What We Mean When We Say “responsive”? <br>
		 	A responsive website is adpative, accessible, and device-appropriate. The sense of flexibility in design makes everything more cohesive and could work efficently on different platforms and screen sizes. Words come to mine are fluidity and cohesiveness to the viewer's visual experience. I think that also goes along with how to the designer choses to layout a website or structure. It's a level of accessibility that everyone can benefit from.
