		 	<li><i>"The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design
is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-follows-function is reconfigured as form-follows-content. If content is the source of form, always
preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even
possible) is some kind of empty shell."</i> <br> i feel like it's important to that the content is priority. the design sets up the formality of the context. you wouldn't have a government website looking like a promotional club page. or having a funeral page looking like a soul cycle website. i do think that form and content can live separately, i don't think without content a design would be empty. something could purely just be visually appealing.. but again that could be its content so i guess then you really can't have one without the other since there's also a reason behind why you designed something such as it is.
