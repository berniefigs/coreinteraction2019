		<h3>describe one non-technical principle learned from each article that you can apply to your web design workflow. the principle does not need to be explicitly stated in the article, but can also be an idea that was generated from your reading and interpretation of the text.</h3>

		 <p> 1. learning about selectors, classes, and divs, i can potentially have error due to messy code. organization with coding is so major key, considering you need to understand what's going on or remind yourself what you've done. i often catch myself making petty errors due to not having my code organized, easily legible.<br>
		 	2. sometimes, less is more. simple can be timeless. i tend to ususally design with darker colors, perhaps that's a bit more sustainable? <br>
		 	3. this is a good reminder that not everyone has the same perspective while surfing the Web or just in general.. sometimes i make really crazy things and forget that it probably isn't the most user-friendly. which i think is okay in some cases if there's creative freedom.<br>
