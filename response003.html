		 <p> Kameelah Janan Rasheed started collecting based on the thought of how the role of archives historically have been used merely to control people. What she has collected she wants to be easily acessible for anyone, for whomever is interested in finding this archive. Knowledge is power. I like how she likes doing an extensive research instead of just going to the library or asking someone for the answer. It's true, when I do researvh via The Web I always find myself in this deep dive, learning about so much more than the topic i set out to research.

		 	Rutherford Chang collects The Beatles' White Album, he began when he realized how each album had its own story and aged differently. It all started with a mere curiousity to see if one album was significantly different from another, and loved to see how they aged. Obesession is just anothe word for intrigue, passion. I find this very amusing, not entirely insane.

		 	Aaron believes self archiving is so important. He said that internet archiving is putting all our eggs in one basket, which is a bit daunting. The beauty of social media platforms is our old posts and thoughts exist. It's always nice to look back and see how what state of mind I was in at that time.
