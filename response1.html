		 	<li>i enjoyed laurel schwult's perspective on the purpose of a website. i agree that the more the effort you put into a website, the more creative it'll get.. the more authenticity starts to seep through. i think i would want my website to be like one of those chaotic dreams where you feel like you have no control over  it, yet it felt so coherent. something like that.</li>
		 	<li>the paragraph when she says that private companies like facebook + instagram prioritize advertising over user's needs, really resonated with me and i was thinking about how true it is. but sometimes i'll see twitter communities of people getitng together, making real connections which is always nice. or like reddit. reddit is such a great online platform. i've also heard that instagram is the worst app for your mental health. i totally agree with that. it's just a highlight reel. i really try to stay off it. it was pure bliss once i deactivated it for 8 months. i should probably do a virtual detox soon.</li></ol></p>
